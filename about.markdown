If you ended up here, consider yourself a little mad:) 

My name is Miki! I am an anthropologist based in Japan and I currently work with rebellious young children.  

I love mad people striving towards a different world. I do not understand madness, but I seek madness. This podcast, her bit of madness, is a means for myself to connect to those working with social change and create an irresistable madness together that encourages a world that works for more. 

The other part of this platform is a collection of my favorite awkward moments. I am incredibly careless and clumsy, and I am still scrambling to find my pieces of madness. 

I invite you to reach out to me or the people who appear on this podcast. Be our friend (or foe!). I look forward to seeing our future generations reap the efforts of our small achievements together.

love,  
miki
