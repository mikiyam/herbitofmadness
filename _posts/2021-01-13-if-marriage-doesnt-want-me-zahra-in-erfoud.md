Zahra Taghlaoui is from Erfoud. Born with a right hand and leg handicap, she is now the main assistant at Anouar Coordination of Associative Action which promotes the inclusion and awareness of diabetes and general disability in Erfoud. For those of you who don't know me, I see stuff when people talk. She's giggling as she bathes in the sunrise on the shores of a lake when she speaks of going to work before her family wakes up and returning home to find her family already asleep. "I cannot stay away from the organization!!" made me laugh. We need more people like her.


<h1>Zahra's Book Recommendations</h1>

 <b>1.  "The Influential Mind" by Tali Sharot </b><br>
'The real gem in this book is that it teaches you how to communicate with somebody whom disagrees with you and you do so by establishing a new concept that does not necessarily disagree with their point of view but does agree with yours; once you find that common ground it can facilitate that conversation and allow you to exert your influence.'

<b>2. "Influence: the psychology of persuasion" by Robert Cialdini</b><br>
'One of the concepts that book breaks down is the contrast principle. I love reading books on influence. Now in everyday life, we not only need to be very good at influencing people at our jobs, whether you are a doctor influencing your patients or a teacher influencing your students but we also need to be aware of those who are trying to influence us or manipulate us.'

<b>3. " What Every BODY is Saying" by Joe Navarro</b><br>
'This is a book covering human body language and most of human communication is non-verbal. When I read this book I began to understand each situation without even needing to hear what people were saying; the entire body gives us a better picture than speech on its own.'

<h1> Full Transcription</h1>

<b>It’s been 6 months since we were scheduled to interview but we never had a chance, and now we are here in December! Can you tell me about you? </b> <br>

My name is Zahra Taghlaoui, I am 31 years old. I had my primary school in a small village and we lived far from the school. Because of my right hand and leg handicap, my uncle brought me to his house in Erfoud. There I had my primary, secondary and high school education, which helped me receive my baccalaureate in modern literature in 2009. I moved to Meknes city for my university study where I received my BA degree in English Linguistics in 2015. I spent the year of 2016 obtaining new medical shoes which I tried for the first time. In 2017, after a couple of months of training by a private school as an English teacher, I started to work with students with mental handicap in an association called Tafilalt of Handicaps, Erfoud. There, I had a chance to attend many training sessions in other cities and in Casablanca which allowed me to communicate with my students with mental handicaps in a way that improved our interactions. In the middle of 2019, I joined another association in the same town Erfoud, named Anouar  Coordination of Associative Action, Erfoud.  This association works with measuring blood pressure among those with diabetes, the prevention of diabetes, inclusion of persons with disabilities, and providing internet for researchers. The leader of the association, Mr. Jilali, is very intellectual and has many experiences. After I joined his association, he taught me what is useful and what is needed in the field of measurement and blood pressure. Because of my willingness to learn, he gave me the responsibility to manage the organization. By then, he had taught deaf people for 11 years. <br>

While Mr. Jilali worked with different activities for mental handicaps inside the association, in 2020 the state asked him to be responsible for a school that was opening an integrated classroom with mental handicaps, and thanks to his previous experience, Mr. Jilali was chosen for the role. Because of my training and experience in teaching those with mental handicaps at another organization, Mr. Jilali invited me once a week to do some activities for his students inside his school. In the past, students with mental handicaps were simply placed in an association, but since 2020, the state has given them a chance to integrate with normal classes. The association that I work for now is always active in terms of activities for people with mental handicaps and also educates the parents about their children with mental handicaps. But all this work is not enough for the needs of mental handicaps. <br>

On the other hand, some of the difficulties that diabetic patients face in Morocco is the lack of treatment and attention from the Minister of Health, the lack of understanding of their illness and what they should eat and not eat. Diabetic patients also suffer from the nonexistence of medications in pharmacies. For example, the people who have to take insulin injections for their diabetes are given insulin injections by the hospital but if one finishes the insulin injections before the end of three months, he or she cannot have another batch of injections, and the patient cannot find these anywhere else. It is why the association is raising more awareness about diabetes and the importance of diet. We also have weekly consultations at the association, which faces an absence of funds except for donations from volunteers and visitors and what the leader provides. The association does not hold huge gatherings that use a large sum of money because of its modest situation but it is still doing good for the citizens. Mr. Jilali is very experienced in different fields, and I hope to learn more through helping him and through my daily contact with him in order to follow the same path that he took all these years. I want to at least be nearly like him and inherit his way of thinking and develop relationships as he does with everyone and find the best safe solution through analyzing each situation according to the problem. 

<b>Can you tell me more about Mr. Jilali?</b><br>

He is very experienced with working in associations and because he has diabetes, too, he learned about diabetes early and from his experience he advises what people should and should not do and eat. He attempts to change people from the Qur’an and explores solutions through listening to each person. Whether it is a social, familial, or personal problem, he tries to find the solution or treatment according to what he reads in the Qur’an or what our Prophet did before. Because we don’t have such a person everywhere, he is an exceptional person and I try to learn from him as much as possible. For example, I am now doing well in terms of measuring blood pressure and understanding diabetes; I help those with diabetes and I give them the same advice that Mr. Jilali gives them and I try to practice everything that Mr. Jilali teaches me during this time I am with him at this association. <br>

There are many things we do at the association besides providing information on blood pressure or teaching mental handicaps; as Mr. Jilali said, our organization provides space for those with some ideas or some projects but do not have the space to come together because of their limited resources. Mr. Jilali tells these people that this association will provide a space for them to create what they want and by doing so, he gives a chance to everyone.<br>

<b>How does your organization run monetarily? For the people who would like to begin an organization but have limited money or resources, what are some advice you can give?</b><br>

It is not about the money; instead, it is about the experience. If someone is rich in their experience or is knowledgeable about every field, it is enough. Most people don’t know what to do and need someone to guide them or advise them, so for example, if someone wants to create an association, he has to be experienced and have patience, listen and understand everyone, and keep their problems and their secrets and try to find solutions according to the situation and from experience. Our leader, Mr. Jilali, has 42 years of experience in this field of association and treating people by the Qur’an. In Erfoud he is the father of all. If anyone wants to begin anything, they ask him for advice; if the proposal is good, Mr. Jilali will tell them it will work, and if it isn’t good, he will advise against it.

<b>Can you give an example of offering treatment following the Qur’an?</b><br>
Within the Qur’an we have passages we call Surah. There are many Surahs in the Qur’an and each one has its name and an important message. For example, we have to believe in Allah; each Surah is different from the other. The Qur’an has many Surahs which describes everything according to our beliefs and our daily life. It discusses every issue, including marriage, divorce, and charity.

<b>What are some rewarding days and what are some difficult days at the organization?</b><br>
I don’t know if there are difficult days because I spend full days at the association trying to help people and to speak with them, whether it is with informing people about Mr. Jilali’s presence or guiding the people; I don’t have any difficulties. Everything is easy for me and my opinion is taken into account and I help in everything so I am the principal one at this association. I am very happy to help people and to be always there for them. The problem is that I cannot stay away from the association.

Sometimes I wake up before my family wakes up to go to the association, and when I return home, my family is already asleep, so I don’t see my family the whole day. I spend most of the day with the people at the association.<br>

The weekend is the time for activities. For example if someone wants to have a meeting or discuss some issues and instead of going to a cafe or if they don't have anywhere to go, we open our association for them. Sunday mornings are for the consultations on diabetes. The association has always had consultations on diabetes on Sunday even before I joined the association because Mr. Jilali is a teacher on most days and  he is only free on Sunday, so he makes Sunday especially for consulting diabetic patients. Therefore, we do not have any weekends or holidays. <br>

<b>As practically one  of the leaders of this organisation, what is it like to be a woman and leading?</b><br>
In our area, if you are a woman it means that you have to get married and have children. If the woman is with a handicap, she cannot get married or have children as other normal girls do, and for me, because of my handicap, it is impossible to get married. All my sisters are married and have children; marriage is something I don’t want—if marriage doesn’t want me, I don’t want it. <br>

I am free to do what I want and go out when I want to do so, which is not possible within marriage. Married woman must stay at her home and take care of her husband and children, and the family. I am trying to be a successful woman and to have my own project and to live my life as good as possible.<br>

<b>What are some of your own projects you want to work on?</b><br>
One project I want to begin is to own a pharmacy for the medications which do not exist in our area that people need. Here in Erfoud, even if anyone finds these medicines in a pharmacy, these medicines are very expensive or rare. Because working with diabetics is my career and my daily work, I want to improve the situation for these people and develop this field in the future and become helpful for people.<br>


<b>Where is Erfoud, what’s it like in Erfoud, why is it your home?</b><br>
You will come after all is well. Erfoud is a small town and now because of COVID and the lack of tourism, Erfoud is a very sleepy town but life is still going on. <br>

<b> What do you like about Erfoud? </b><br>
It’s not dangerous like big cities like Casablanca. In addition, in Erfoud people lack the consciousness towards diabetics persons and people with mental handicaps. With the experience that I have, I don’t want to go somewhere else while Erfoud needs a lot of help, so I hope to stay in Erfoud to work on these issues, and to be close to my family and stay safe.

<b>Do you want to bring more women in this field as well? </b><br>
Yes, if for example, our work projects expand, it is good to seek help from others and ask other women who are not married to help me; for those who are married, marriage is the only project for them. There are very few women who are married and doing something outside of marriage.<br>

<b>What are some things that are particular about you that not a lot of people know about?</b><br>
[Laughs.] I think Mr Jilali can answer this question. Mr Jilali told me that I am very helpful and patient which are qualities he didn’t find in other people. He brought me into his daily activities because I am patient and helpful, and because I am not materialistic.

<b>Can you tell me how COVID is impacting your area and how that is impacting your work? </b><br>
During the quarantine, people were afraid and were paying attention to the precautions and not going anywhere. However, after the quarantine, all Moroccan people become careless, not just in Erfoud. The people don’t wear any masks and shake hands; they don’t believe in the existence of COVID-19! In our association we asked people to wear a mask indoors and to use alcohol sanitisation for their hands, but the problem is, they don’t care. Even if we do educate people on the precautions at the front door and inside of the organization, most people don’t care. There was a time when someone entered and she wanted to shake my hand, but I refused because I pay attention to COVID-19. 

I have heard about the vaccine but we still do not have it in Erfoud and we are not sure if it works. I do hope we have this vaccine soon and that it will be successful so that we can return to our normal life. Welcome to Erfoud. <br>

<b>Thank you! I will love to go and it’s been a dream to go to Morocco. I still haven’t been there even though I was really close to getting there. Thank you very much Zahra for giving me a peek into what it is like to live in Erfoud. Thank you, Zahra! </b><br>

You are welcome, I will send you some pictures and I hope that you will like them. Keep in touch.
