Nazwa is our guest today! I’m particularly fond of Nazwa and I like all of her social media posts (I wonder if she finds me strange? Maybe a little creepy. Ah, mad!) She is based in Dhaka where she is an entrepreneur and a researcher (among other things). Having lived in seven countries in my life, I struggle to find my belonging, but in her work, Nazwa illustrates we can create belonging—for ourselves and for others. Since last August, she and her team are facilitating dialogue between the indigenous communities in Bangladesh and the Bangali population in Bangladesh. Thank you Nazwa, for your courage.  

<h1>Nazwa recommends these books!</h1>

**1. 'Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World--and Why Things Are Better Than You Think' by Hans Rosling**  

'This book is a must read. It changes how we understand and learn about our surroundings. Often there are news and stories in media that is over exaggerated or biased and we can eradicate these biases.'  

**2. 'Wanderlust' by Daniel Steel**  

'It's a light story of a young woman who wants to travel the world, but is torn between her dreams and duties.' 

**3. 'A Very Short Introduction Series' by Oxford Publication**  

'This is not a single book, but if you want to learn about a certain topic and you're struggling to find specific and organised content, they have an excellent collection of introductory books on a range of topics.'

<h1>Full Transcription</h1>

**Hey Nazwa! Hi how are you doing?**   
I’m doing good, how about you?

**I’m doing good as well. For those of us who don’t know you, who are you and what do you do?**  

My name is Nazwa Tahsin; I live in Dhaka Bangladesh! I am an environmental researcher and an entrepreneur. Today I would like to talk about my entrepreneur side that works with indigenous communities in Bangladesh.

**Can you tell us about Beyond The Hills?**  

The goal at Beyond the Hills is to mainstream the knowledge and culture of indigneous communities in Bangladesh. Most of the indigenous communities in the countryside are disintegrated with the mainstream community and because of their language and lifestyle and because they are often outnumbered, they are victims of racism and violence. There is a communication gap between the mainstream community and the indigenous community and to bridge that gap, we need to mainstream indigenous knowledge to develop empathy for the community and learn from each other as well. This doesn’t only benefit the indigenous community; it can benefit the mainstream community as well. There’s so much knowledge that the indigenous communities have, especially regarding nature conservation and society.

Whenever we talk about indigenous communities in Bangladesh, people first think of the communities which live in the Chittagong Hill tracks, but we actually have 49 communities of indigenous communities in Bangladesh which do not reside in Chittagong hill tracks. They are scattered all over the country, and there are smaller communities that people don’t know about, which is why we call our project Beyond the Hills. We wanted to address indigenous communities outside of the hill areas. 

**Can you elaborate more on what kind of racism they face?**  

There are two types of racism that they face: one is specifically about their food habits and culture and the other is about the matriarchal societies that form the basis of their societies; mainstream Bangali societies are more patriarchal and they make fun of matriarchal societies. With regards to their differences in diet, many inidgenous communities eat frogs and other items like snakes, which is also looked down upon by the mainstream community because they don’t eat that. Another aspect of racism is towards their physical features. Most of the indigenous people in Bangladesh are from the hill track areas and a prominent feature is their eyes; they have very strong mongoloid features like slinted small eyes and a bigger nose, and they are called ching chong; again, the mainstream community is judging these indigenous communities based on what is beautiful within their standards. If we can bridge that gap to illustrate that principles good or bad can change from society to society, and if we can bridge that gap, hopefully this kind of racism can cease. These are some of the basic racism that most of those surveyed reported from the indigenous community. 

We actually did a session in Beyond the Hills named 'Debunking myths, stigmas and true facts', and we had three episodes in the series. The first two sessions were about racism and how it hinders them from receiving education or interacting with other communities and getting jobs. I would like to give you the link to this.

I will try to upload the video on Youtube with translation which will help you understand; we circulated a google form to get the response from some members of the indigeous community with regards to what type of racism they are facing and how it impacts them in their daily lives, and we received many responses. They talked about how constant bullying because of their facial features and their food habits which has hindered socializing with other kids, and sometimes they couldn’t make friends.

**Why did you start this project after working with the slums and with your own research?**  

Do you remember the ‘don’t rush’ challenge? It was popular through tick tock and Facebook, and we came across this one video where there were some girls doing the ‘don’t rush’ challenge and in the background they played a song in their indigenous language and it was a beautiful piece of music, but we couldn't understand what the song meant. It inspired my four friends and I to uncover the meanings and we realized that there is no way to learn about it or what it means since there are not enough resources in translation of music. We started to look at why there aren’t enough resources in translations  and luckily we connected with one of my junior who belongs to this indigenous community and she shared some of her experiences. It made us realize that we need to do something regarding this and that’s when we started to work on this and eventually started Beyond the Hills.

**How do you reach out to most of the indigenous community?**  

We started with people we knew in our university area and work and used the snowball process: you know one person and through them you get to know the others.

**What is one really memorable experience from your work so far?**  

The most memorable would be the stigma and fact series in that I learned so much from that series, and in December 31 2020 we published a magazine which I will give the link to you shortly. These two experiences in particular are very important; as a Bangali person I do have some understanding of what goes on including how there is a lot of violence in many of the places where indigenous people live, but having access to these stories made the experience very memorable in that looking at statistics and listening to people’s stories first hand is something very different. It has inspired me to work even harder for this cause. 

**How is the organization managing financially?**  

I would say it’s a startup in the beginning phase since we only started in August of 2020 so it’s not been very long, but we have managed to raise donations. Until recently we used these personal donations for one school in Bandarban which is a place in Bangladesh where a lot of indigenous people live, so we are contributing to the management and supporting the school with education and donation. Other activities are completely voluntary to this day and we do wish to extend our work. We have a project in Beyond the Hills that aims to create voice translations softwares because much of the indigenous knowledge, music, and stories are passed down generations through speech, and there aren’t many documentations about it. Many YouTube videos do not have translations but we have the resources. We have a mentoring program as well, in which we mentor indigenous students to motivate them to learn English and other languages if they want to and to do better in maths. 

**Does most of the indigenous communities speak Bangla as well?**  

They have to learn Bangla because Bangla is the official language and also the language of the majority. They do have their native languages, but sadly because there aren't enough resources to promote education in their own language, some of the languages are at risk of disappearing. We are trying to help these communities to revive their languages through our translation project.

**Are there some more things you would like to tell me about Beyond the Hills?**  
We are mostly a group of people who are self motivated to work on the cause, so I really love working on this project. I would like people to have more empathy for the indigenous community around the world, because in most places they are still marginalized and face racism and violence. We aim to inspire people to work on more communities. 

**Because we have made social change so distant from people in some sense as it always is in either in academia or in a realm that is very serious and political, the human side of people are often erased from the general picture, so I have a series of questions to ask you about you because I want to know about you as a person.**

*

***The latter part of question was immersed in unfamiliar sounds coming from Nazwa's microphone, which I was surprised to hear.***

It’s a call for prayers here; we have prayers five times a day so before the prayers they do this, we call it Azan.

***While we waited for the calls for prayers to subside, we digressed into one of my favorite subjects: local food.***


**Frogs and snakes are not part of the diet in Bangladesh?**  
No no.  

**What is the main food in Bangladesh?**  

In Bangladesh we mainly eat rice, fish, sometimes, if you are in urban areas, you eat a lot of chicken as well, beef, mostly halal food, but they kind of stick to fish, chicken, beef, and some vegetables.  

**Nothing like snakes or frogs?**  

Nothing like that; the indigenous people live in a completely different ecosystem so their food habits are different from that of the Bengalis. Most of the Bengalis live on plain land near big rivers so their diet is very dependent on fish and the indigenous communities live in rather hillt areas where frogs and snakes are abundant.

**Have you tried the cuisine from the indigenous communities before?**  

I did try the frog dish; it’s delicious and tastes like chicken.  

**I used to eat frogs in Hong Kong, which are called tin-gai in cantonese, and the people put them in a pot and we have this pot of frogs in it, and it was really good.**  

Here in the rural community they cook it in a different way from Hong Kong, but it tastes very much like chicken.

**Who is a role model from your life?**

My real life role model would be my mother; she’s very hardworking, she loves to work for improving human lives and for social causes and this has impacted me since childhood. While in our society today women are working in different sectors, that wasn’t the case even ten years ago when I was a child. My mother was working very hard, and she went through challenges to maintain work life balance and convincing people in our neighborhood and family that she could do this. There were people who asked her to focus on her three kids instead of working this much but she managed and did her work fantastically, which was very inspirational for me. I look up to her with regards to the principles in life and with working hard for some cause that is bigger than yourself and your family which improves the society. She is a real life model. 

I do have other figures who are inspirational; I particularly like the German president Angela Merkel. She is very bold and also very knowledgeable and I aspire to be someone like her. Since I am a researcher and because we don’t really have many women in the science or research sector, and I am also a big fan of Marie Curie; she received two Nobel Prizes in physics and chemistry and she even pursued her higher education in university. She challenged the status quo and she has done such brilliant work and she is inspiring for me to pursue knowledge and research.

**What is your bit of madness?**  

I do not hesitate to try new things. It can be crazy and it is extremely challenging, but it’s fun for me! Things that normally people are afraid of are some things I enjoy, so it might seem crazy but you can do unexpectedly amazing things and you can overcome that fear. It makes my parents worry about me but that’s okay.

**What is an example of you doing something that other people are afraid of doing?**  

For example I like traveling to mountains and hiking; my parents are afraid of such activities. With regards to my career, instead of being a full-time researcher, I am working on other projects as well. It is challenging because you have to do a lot of work and you might not succeed with what you begin, but again, someone has to try.

**What are some advice you would give to young women who would like to do the work you are doing right now?**  

I would like to advise them to not be afraid to challenge the status quo. Because in most cultures, women are taught to be very careful about how they physically appear, how they act among other things, and are excessivevly self-conscious which pulls them back from creating impactful work. I want women to be more brave and challenge society and ask questions. Be bold, be brave. Other things follow when you are bold and brave.

**Thank you Nazwa. If anyone wants to reach out to you, how can they do so?**

They can email me, I recently deactivated my facebook since I have a lot of workload, but they can email me and I will leave the link to my email.

**Thank you very much Nazwa for today!**  

Thank you Miki for having me.
