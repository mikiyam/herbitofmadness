<h1>Full transcription/Summary</h1>

**Hi, Sophia. This is my first time meeting you. For those of us who don't know you, who are you and what do you do?**

Hello, my name is Sophia. I am from Mexico. I am an activist, but I am also a business woman. I own a consulting firm that aims to have a positive social and environmental impact in Mexico and hopefully in Latin America.

We need to act in order to protect the ecosystems that we are surrounded by. Especially now that I'm a mother, I realize that we have to protect the planet, so we can assure that we're gonna be able to live a healthy lifestyle and protect other species that also live on this planet. 

**What kind of projects are you running at this moment?**

We are very proud of the campaign we are preparing for the United Nations, which advocates for the animals in danger of going extinct. Some of these animals only live in Mexico and it's very important that we generate and share knowledge on these species, not only with scientists and decision-makers, but also with the general public.

We understand how important it is to protect these species and how close we are to losing them. There are now very important efforts to help these species continue existing and we need to inform others that these efforts are being made. We have produced a 10 minute video, and now we have a whole campaign in which we're reproducing eight other videos that are shorter for social media. 

We work with 14 different species, including jaguars and eagles; the Mexican flag has an eagle, a spirit animal for many Mexican indigenous groups. I'm very passionate about this project. 

**Can you give an example of what it would mean if one of the species goes extinct?**

It's known within science but also within traditional knowledge that everything is interconnected in an ecosystem. If one species disappears, it has an impact on the whole ecosystem. We do not understand all of the consequences. It's not only the species we're looking after, but also their habitats, because the habitats impact us as well; if we are protecting the water that the animals drink, we're also protecting the water that brings a whole ecosystem into existence. The consequences of losing one of these species goes towards our lives, which is one of the main points of the campaign.

**How did you get here?**

I started to work in NGOs and I always thought that it was something I aspired to, but the more I went into people's problems, I saw that the lack of access to natural resources made people poor. I grew more fond of trying to see the whole picture, exploring how we live on this planet.

Most people are looking to get a big house or a car, or pursuing a career that brings them stability. I do want a stable job, but I also want to have an impact in the salient issues that concern us as a society.

My last job in an office was in investment fund. It was a very good job, and most people didn't understand why I left the job. I've had experiences in my past that illustrated I can't live a life without following my convictions or my dreams, because I might have the money but I'm not really listening to my heart. It sounds very cliche, but it is why I decided to own my own company. 

It was a Japanese program on a ship that guided me to take this big decision. This program is called the Ship for World Youth, and it's a program that has been running for more than 30 years. This program was very important for my career because it empowered me as a young person to be a leader, and to follow my drive to run my own projects.

After I went on this trip, I returned to my old job and that was the routine. A few years later though, I wanted to own my own company and choose the projects that I yearned for. When I was on the ship, I was next to the ocean and isolated from everything and it reminded me what I had really wanted and that I was living on this one planet. If we deplete the resources on this planet, we will not have this place no more and everything else finishes. Protecting this planet should be a priority for everyone.

**What were some difficulties when you started your own company?**

It's definitely been challenging because as an entrepreneur, I've come from doubting whether what I'm doing is the right thing to do to acquiring contracts and clients. When I am writing a report late at night, or when I am stressed about a deadline, I lose sight that what I am doing is going to have a real impact on people. 

Reminding my team of our vision has also been challenging, especially when we go through stressful situations. In Mexico to open up a company, the legal fees are expensive and the process is slow. When I was trying to get big clients as a UN or a big company and I didn't even have a paper that indicated my company's legal status, it was very difficult to get clients. Especially as a young woman in a place like Mexico, where the government is overwhelmed, it's very difficult to do anything that involves the government's approval. You just have to remind yourself it takes time and you have to persevere.

The government here is not as efficient as we would want it to be. We also have different options, like working with other companies or with other NGOs in a project-based approach. I had to explore my alternatives in order to overcome these challenges.

**What is the memorable experience from your work that you have encountered through these years?** 

Working with the communities is the most memorable for me, even though for much of my work I spend behind the screen, taking phone calls and reviewing documents. 

We have the desert, the jungle, the beaches--these are beautiful places. I'm lucky to come from a country that is one of the most ecologically diverse in the world. It's very inspiring to enter the jungle and witness all of the species that live there and the diversity in the people. Part of Mexican history involves Spaniards arriving on their ships and demanding to own everything. All of the indigenous groups which were not killed ran into the mountains, and lived in the exotic lands. I'm very lucky to have met indigenous people who fight for their land and women who continue to maintain traditional knowledge and respect for nature. The most important part of my job is to keep this traditional knowledge alive and sharing these beautiful places and people. 

**How much of your work is related to indigenous persons?**

I've been working with indigenous communities for 10 years. We don't currently have an active project that gets us paid as a company to work with indigenous people, but I am here for them when they need me.

I consider myself a member of an indigenous community as well, even though I grew up in a city and I've been lucky enough to study in the United States and in Europe and I have a British husband--my life has been very international. I'm a traditional Mexica dancer. If we need a new drum or a new costume or we are having a ceremony, I always make the time to do so because that's what gives me the motivation to keep going, even though it doesn't involve anything professionally.ã€€We are a group of people recovering some of the ancient dances and songs that disappeared for centuries after the Spaniards arrived. The Mexica dancers kept it in secret and the elders kept it to themselves and now it's becoming a movement to recover these songs.

**What are your sources of inspiration that goes into your work or goes into your life?** 

The inspirations of my work are derived from the experiences I've had in the past. Sharing with a variety of people allows me to understand that we all want to lead better lives, we all want to be healthy and that we all need water and food.

We're always with our phones or our computers in the big cities, and while there are a lot of valuable information there, we are losing the community life in which we always have someone to rely on and have a a decent work life balance. Within indigenous communities and in rural communities, the community life has not disappeared as much as it has in the big cities. I used to live in Mexico city, one the biggest cities in the continent and I was stressed all the time. I longed to swim in the river. As humans, we're missing out on so much beauty because we are so busy stressing about money or traffic. When we remove ourselves from that, it's relieving to understand we are a part of a connected world that allows us to belong to humanity. I like attending traditional dances and talking to people who may tell you stories from 600 years ago. Most people my age don't have those conversations.

Most people are worried about other things like becoming a boss or making more money, so my inspiration comes from listening to possibilites of life in different cultures or in different spaces. 

**What is the story from 600 years ago that you can share?**

I don't want to sound very strange, but this is the kind of things that I love. At a dancing ceremoy, I met a man who had given up his life in the city and devoted his life to finding ancient drums. 600 years ago, when there was an important event in this area that involved a call to action, indigenous communities took out massive giant drums made from the biggest trees in the jungle.

Imagine the biggest tree you can--these were carved into drums. There were very big drums and now people are looking for them. Maybe they just disappeared, but there is someone that is making one because he wants all of the communities to come together and fight climate change. 

Even though I do work in a corporate office and I have to sign contracts and make phone calls with clients, knowing that alternative lives still exist inspire me. 

**What is one thing you are very grateful for?**

I am editing five books about gender equality and gender violence the past week, and I have been reading terrible stories and data about gender violence in Mexico.

We are one of the countries that murder the most women. I've never had any violence in my life and Mexico is known worldwide for being a violent country; I'm grateful I've never been around that violence, even though I am an activist and many poeple that do what I do, not from an office, but from the field, are killed or recieve threats on their lives. Many journalists, especially female journalists, are putting their lives at risk every time they work. That hasn't been my case. I also have a great family that supports me and a great husband who is definitely not violent. It's very important for a Mexican woman to have a husband who does not impose limitations on her dreams and that he's actually supportive of them. While I'm talking to you, he's looking after our daughter.

I've come to realize how important that is and how grateful I am for that. 

**What is your bit of madness?** 

[Her daughter came in!]

**Oh, she's so cute. Does she speak English or Spanish more?**

Now she's speaking a bit more Spanish, but she understands both languages. This one here is my bit of madness. My bit of madness is that I am a flexible person, so I'm adaptable and resilient. I do get mad sometimes. I am very disorganized. My bit of craziness comes when I stay up late and then I struggle to get up and I drink a lot of coffee.

It is very messy. A day can look like signing a contract of hundreds of thousands of pesos, all the way to cleaning poop or recieiving the mail. Many things have to take place in a short period of time. 

**What is a piece of advice you can give to women who want to do the work you are doing right now?**

I don't have it all figured out, but try not to hold onto fear. Sometimes when you want to do something and you're afraid you won't be able to do it or that you're gonna do it wrong, it's not useful.

There's always a doubt in the back of my head. Am I actually going to be able to do this? Just recognize that the doubt is always going to be there and be mindful of it as much as possible and work on the next thing you actually need to do in order to make things happen. 

**If anyone wants to reach out to you, how can they do so?** 

You can reach me via my LinkedIn account; it's Sophia Camacho, which is a very Mexican name. My email is sophia@kaxan.org.

My company's name, Kaxan, is Mayan and it means to look or to research. 

**Thank you very much for today.**

Thank you, Miki.
