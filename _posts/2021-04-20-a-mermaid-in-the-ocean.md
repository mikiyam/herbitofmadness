There are people I meet and I wonder “Wait, did I know you…in another life?” Leni is one of these people! She and Maggie are the hosts of the podcast Pochas So What, a platform for the deported and returned community. She is now an activist on migrant rights in Mexico City after she was forcefully returned when she was 16. Leni is also a part-time mermaid (!!!!!!!) 

<h1>Full transcription/Summary</h1>

**Leni, how are you today?** 

I'm doing good. You might hear some paws running around. So I am sitting here in Mexico City.

**You're currently with your sister right now as well. For those of us who don't know you, who are you and what do you do?**

My name is Leni Alvarez. I am a podcaster and a migrant social activist. I was raised undocumented and I found out I was undocumented at the age of 16, and I am back in Mexico as part of the returned and deported community. I am currently raising a voice as a Brown woman and a pocha in Mexico.

**What is a pocha, and what is it like to identify as a pocha?** 

Taking a step back within the Mexican American diaspora, there's this term called Chicano or Chicana which started off as an offensive term. Many labels within our own communities begin as discriminatory, but there was a political and social movement of being proud of being Chicano or Chicana and these words describe a person who is born in the United States from Mexican heritage.

I was raised in the U S. My sister arrived when she was eight months and I arrived when I was two years and a half. My brothers are Chicanos because they were born in the U.S. from Mexican parents Mexican heritage. My mom and dad were undocumented. I was in a state of limbo; in Mexico they used this term pocha to group somebody who basically doesn't speak Spanish very well, who was either raised in the U.S. or isn't 'Mexican' enough.

Pocha has been used as a derogatory term. It has indigenous roots where it means a rotten fruit, a discolored food or something that has been yanked from its roots. A lot of our community can relate to how we were yanked from our roots because of the border and because of the wall, of how we lived in exile as we now live in exile in Mexico from like our U.S. community.

While we were in the U S we also lived in exile from our motherland. What does it mean to be a pocha? For me, it means to be a woman who was raised in documented and is now part of the deported and returned to community. But it's also saying 'so what', in the sense that I'm thriving in this third space of not trying to grab onto one border or to one country, but at the end of the day, I'm made up of many cultures.

**So your podcast, Pochas So What is this reflection of your life in some ways?**

For sure. So Pochas So What is a podcast that I co-created with Maggie who is another pocha I found along the way and who is a dear friend and we have a lot to say, but at the same time, we know our community has a lot to say. For a long time, people really didn't hear about the deported and returned community. It wasn't really until Trump came into office and into his presidency that people began to notice family separation. Family separation has been going on for decades and deportations have been going on for decades.

We were hearing these narratives on the news of who we are and we're like, Yeah, some elements are there, but they're telling the stories they want to tell. We want to tell the stories we want to tell, and we want to be able to also provide a story for our community to be able to connect.

**What does Otros Dreams in Accion do to support the community in Mexico?**

Maggie is the co-founder of ODA and a little bit of a backstory of ODA.

There's a book called Los Otros Dreamers, or the other dreamers, because we are part of a generation. In the U.S. there was an uprising of undocumented immigrants in which people came out as undocumented and unafraid as an undocumented person when DACA and talks of a pathway to citizenship started with our community. It was a result of a failure of a legislation that would grant a pathway to all undocumented people to be able to have citizenship in the country. People knew that they needed to advocate and lift up their voices. 

Maggie and I came back before that period. If we were to be still in the U.S. we would have entered under that title of a dreamer. The book, The Other Dreamers or Los Otros Dreamers, is a recollection of 26 stories of deportees and returnees who came back before DACA passed. DACA was not a solution.

We stood against the narrative of what they wanted to structure the dreamer movement around. They directed blame towards the parents and reinforced the idea that you have to be a deserving immigrant, like the next Ivy league, the next Einstein, or the next doctor discovering the cure for cancer.

We wanted to illustrate the diversity within the community because while there are some people choose education and university, but there are also other choices taken within our community. We also have communities that have been in the incarceration systems because of the origins of the communities that they were brought in, for example, in the ghetto.

With the Black Lives Matter movement, there was a debate over how the incarceration system works in the U S and how it targets people of color, and specifically men. Within Los Otros Dreamers, we nourished a seed which then became to what is ODA today. 

Maggie was able to obtain mobility after eight years after she had been in Mexico, basically living in exile until she was able to obtain a B1 and B2 visa.

This gave a pathway for her to be able to go back to the U.S. and this book was edited by Jill Anderson, who is the other co-founder of ODA. They were able to go on a book tour when Trump was running for election and then he won. They decided they couldn't book this book back in the shelf: we needed to take action because we know there's going to be more mass deportations or even just the fear of deportation will push people to return to the country. One of the biggest deportation waves and returned waves in our country was between 2005 and 2009, which was actually during the end of the Bush and early in the Obama era.

That was when Mexico witnessed net zero migration in which a similar number of people were coming back and going out, or even more people were coming back than going from Mexico to the United States. ODA is an organization that is led by and for the returned and deported community, those that are facing a possible deportation and fear of deportation or have come back because of the deportation of a family member. This year, one of the biggest mission at ODA has been to organize translocally. Pochas So What aims to be a bridge between our deported and returned community with our undocumented community over the border.

Right now there is a lot of movement with the new Biden administration of remembering we're here and reparations are not just for deportees during the Trump era, but deportees even under his era when he was vice-president. 

**What are some difficulties that returnees to Mexico face?**

One of the difficulties is navigating the bureaucratic system. After living 10, 20, 30 or more years out of the country, ironically enough, when someone returns undocumented to Mexico, once again, he/she is an undocumented person. So our official IDs, which are called Enis are very tied into the election ID card and that's basically the most powerful ID we have in Mexico. And during this time lapse of four months, nobody can access an ID during our election period.

So imagine if you're a deportee or returnee just arriving and for four months you will be undocumented in this country. That means not being able to obtain a job sometimes not even being able to enter certain buildings because they require you to have this ID to rent an apartment and so on. 

If you're from a small town, sometimes the registration offices doesn't operate perfectly. If they lost your file or something like a flood took place and your paperwork was gone, you don't have an identity here.

Even though my sister has been back in the country for 11 years, she still hasn't been able to obtain even a passport because of her identity documents; she had to change her last name. So they have a lot of problems within like the registration that for 11 years, she hasn't even been able to obtain a passport being a Mexican back in Mexico.

We are also denied education because of having to revalidate school documents. There was a lot of work within our community to advocate, to be able to make education accessible for the community. There was some reforms which passed, but the trickling down of this information to like the localities that we come to, because at this moment I'm in Mexico city.

I came down to a rural town in Veracruz where like nobody knew what to do with us. Even though we had been to the Mexican consulate while in the US, and we recieved paperwork that we needed to enter school. When we came back, the reality is very different, as our documents were not recognized. 

**Why does your sister have to change her last name?** 

My dad crossed over first while my sister was still in my mom's belly.

My sister was always raised in the United States as medium fittest Spiritus and I'm Alvarez Perez. My parents wanted to change her name here and recognize her as part of the family. If they had known it would cause so many complications, they wouldn't have done it, but because her transcripts and all of that from the United States is written, as many as I could Spanish.

Even in school, she hasn't been able to like finish a university degree because they say like, you're not the same person. Like here you say you're Alvarez and they're like, your first, last name is Betas. So like, we can't accept you in our school. And because of that as well she hasn't been able to even access a passport.

**You mentioned on your podcast that your podcast is a space for people who do not belong aqui or alli, like you don't belong here or there.**

It's the feeling of feeling neither from here nor there, but then also having to claim that I am from here and there because I was born in this country, but I was also raised there to be able to also declare I have the rights or I should have the rights as a human in these spaces as well.

**I barely feel like I identify with some country; when I'm in Japan, people are like, what is your nationality? I reply I have a Japanese passport but 'oh you don't sound Japanese'. It's like they are saying you don't belong here. Maybe I'm just a Japanese pocha.** 

You are a Japanese Pocha girl! That's acually something we touch on as well, because our deported and returned community isn't just in Mexico and in the United States. There is this legislation called the new way forward and we learned that it was actually pushed by Southeast Asian undocumented community that had been deported specifically to Cambodia as well, talking about the ramifications that they lived because of deportation.

We also have deportees and returnees in Haiti, Jamaica, Dominican Republic and Venezuela. Our community is all over the place and it clearly illustrates the influences of the U.S. everywhere in the world. Our designer, Andrea, who does the artwork for the podcast lives in Germany. She shared that she met a pocha Peruvana, a Peruvian pocha who was raised in Florida, but is from Peru and is currently living in Germany.

**A pocha is a cooler way of calling someone a global citizen! What is the biggest surprise you've had in the last few months and why?**

Ooh. So this one is very, very fresh. I recently found out that I am epileptic.
In November I had my first big seizure. But I actually found out this month that I've had it since I was a little girl and it ties into knowing more of my own migration story.

I was born to a 16 and a half year old mom, since my mom and dad were married at a very young age. The origins of my epilepsy can be pinned down to either two moments in my life. 

The first moment is when I was in my mom's stomach as a fetus and part of my right side of my brain didn't finish developing. I always said I had a Dory brain and I actually found out now that I do medically have some memory problems. The second possible explanation is that I was born literally in a house of sticks with a midwife because there was no access to hospitals. I surpassed the 12th hour giving birth time. That could already have affected me. When I was one year and three months old, I fell from a meter and a half; they had to like drain my head of blood. I didn't know pieces of my own story, even though I talk a lot about my story. I had to go to the neurologist with my parents and I'm barely learning this as a 26 year old. Another thing about 2020 was it had been very healing, because one of the biggest dreams that I've found is to be a mermaid.

I discovered the mermaiding community. This week with everything going on, I needed something to bring me some comfort in my life, and hence I bought my first mermaid tail. I hopefully will have it with me in a couple of months. 

**Oh! Why do you want to be a mermaid?**

I've always wanted to be a mermaid. 

It's connected with a lot of things. 2020 was the year my body was giving me a lot of signs that then led up to this big seizure. I thought I was going through depression, because I had just left a job that I thought was my dream job. I didn't know what I was doing with my life. I stepped out of a three-year relationship. Everything was going on. And mermaiding was my escape that year. Like I would just pass hours like scrolling and watching YouTube videos and pictures of mermaiding and so this year, I'm also sharing a bit more about me and I'm a lot more comfortable in sharing it.

Three years ago I suffered, or  I now have learned the term survivor. I went through rape three years ago. One of my last dreams that I had of this moment was one in which I felt a lot of anxiety in my dream and I felt like I was getting persecuted by a shadow man that I dived into the ocean and I became a mermaid and I found serenity within the water. In Florida I was raised by the beach and whenever I would go play, I would always imagine I was a mermaid as a little girl. I always questioned the fish swim between the border we have in Tijuana, since part of the border is in the ocean. I want to be a mermaid that doesn't even know what borders are. It has to do a lot with freedom.

**Thank you for your sharing. It must have been really difficult for you.**

It's been a process for sure. It has been difficult, but through acknolwedging and sharing my experience, it helps to heal.

**That's very true. We tend to avoid grief in our society. When someone talks about something that has happened to them or something they've gone through, they just get quiet and let the conversation fade out.**

I did that for the three years until that moment, so 2020 I also started going to a therapist. And so that really helped, but it was because I had recognized within myself the point of, as you mentioned, no, I didn't want to talk about it. And I thought I had put it in a box and that I was continuing life and I was doing very cool things and I was excelling in the things that I was doing, but I kind of felt like I was turning into this workaholic as well, because I just didn't want to feel and even Pochas So What I met Maggie, it's going out to towards four years ago that we met. And the very first day that we met, we talked about opening up this YouTube channel or this podcast for our community and stuff.

And unfortunately, a couple of months after this this happened, and I didn't recognize at that moment, but I really went into like my own self. Like I even really drifted away even from Maggie and just friends in general. And didn't want to do anything more than just like focus on what I was doing at work.

And it wasn't until this moment of reflection that I was like, okay, this has been taking, as you mentioned, it has been taken away away from me more than like more than I thought, I guess, because I thought I could just put it in a box and not say anything about it or I thought I had processed it and it was easier to, to shut it out.

At some point I decided not to dust it off, because it's always been present and I need to face it. It was taking away the power that it has been dominating over me, and turn the tables around. Pochas So What came out of this pandemic period, and it's been a pandemic baby. It's also been this self recognizing and self healing that I really am thankful as well with Maggie to like after these three or four years, I'm like, okay, I'm alright, and she was like, finally!

**Sometimes I see pictures when people talk; it's easier for me to do so, because I think it's also part of my healing. I see how you've put yourself in a, like a cardboard box and now you're like punching holes through that box. So you're like, I'm going to get out of this. Yeah. That's what I hear in many ways.** 

That's actually a really good visual; I even visualize that too, we are connected!

**Thank you for your sharing. Despite all that has happened or in all of that, that has happened, what is this one thing that really stuck with you?**

For a long time, I thought I was the only one and within our pocha and in the deported and returned community, we think we're the only ones who have gone through this. A lot more is spoken about us. When I came back, it wasn't until three or five years that I was back in Mexico that I met another person like me, other than my siblings. I wanted to discover more of my community, which led me to meet Jill Anderson. I read Jill's book in academia and she actually signed the book and in it she writes, 'the fight continues'. She also added 'en cualquier lado de la frontera que estes' in whichever side of the border you are. As a returned woman for a long time, I had no idea who I am in this country. I lost my identity. I had no idea what I wanted to be. I felt lost. WHen I finally began to rebuild who I was and find this past with my community one of the biggest things for me is that the fight continues. I've had the fortune of meeting community in Honduras, in Guatemala and in Salvador--people who are standing and advocating in many parts of the world. 

One of the things I have learned is that even though I had to forcibly come back and leave the place I called home, nobody could take away my voice. 

**Your voice that powers your podcast and your activism. You're a mermaid crossing the borders.** 

I'm not really good at singing, but maybe I should take some singing classes so I can also be a singing mermaid, using my voice.

**What is one of your favorite childhood story?**

I was actually scrolling through some pictures some time ago. I remembered one of my favorite childhood stories was the time I went fishing with my dad and my little sister and we had our little chairs and he would put the little worm on our hooks, even though we wouldn't do anything because he was fishing with his friends. I had this really fun memory of my sister and I leaning on palm trees, with our icees from Seven Eleven and sipping on them and watching the sunset in Florida.

I want to get this memory tattooed on me to commemorate that moment. 

**My dad also brought us fishing when I was young. It doesn't feel like it's my first time meeting you for some reason. What do you like most about yourself?**

What do I like most about myself? I just had my session with my psychologist today. I reflected a lot on creativity and that has been something that I didn't recognize as a little girl. I even believed I'm not good at drawing. I do stick figure but I've even discovered watercoloring and more abstract things.

In everything that I do, I do it as a creative outlet and it has been a way of healing, but at the same time, I love feeling like this buzz of like doing something or imagining something. So I would say creativity right now in the session that I had today. I'm also part of influencing our narratives and influencing the cultural creation of who we are as well.

So maybe I would say understanding creativity as this cultural power to be able to shift narratives, but also creativity and doing the things I enjoy to do other than maybe per se migration, other than maybe per se, something that has to do with something that, like, I raised more voice of like an advocacy voice, but also just being creative in my day to day.

**What is an example of being creative from day-to-day?**

I would say that element of watercoloring it was the first time that I recognized that I didn't have to be this like Picasso or like this artist, but like, my creativity was just putting on music and just like painting colors, even though I have no idea like if it's art or not, like, this is me being, just putting my feelings into a paper. 

**Oh, that is beautiful. Like I struggle a lot with drawing. Like as much as I love drawing, it just seems like I don't have that creative spark in me or I've come to, so scared of making a mistake in art, you know, like scared of putting the wrong colors together, scared of using the wrong strokes.**

Sometimes art can be very rigid but art is supposed to be totally the opposite, no? It's supposed to be this creative element that inspires you to be in touch with your feelings. I've been learning how not to care about whether I call myself an artist or not. It's like me doing this.

**What is your bit of madness?**

I'm still processing this word madness, but within all of this, there is a this yarn, but as though a cat had played around with it a whole bunch and it was so tangled and I didn't know like where it even started.

My bit of madness would be finding where it starts. In my case it would be my voice. My madness is my voice and everything that I have lived. 
It's been a process.

It wasn't this is me from the very beginning, but now it's like grabbing onto the beginning of the yarn and pulling it towards me--that would be my bit of madness.

**You've been pushing this huge ball of yarn with you for a really long time, and now you're sitting down and just kind of trying to untangle it.**

Yeah. I'm having a conversation with it now. 

**Ooh, a talking ball of yarn. If people want to reach out to you how can they do so?** 

We are on all social media platforms, but we are much more active on Instagram. On every Tuesday, we hold live streams and hop on with other community members and have what we call cafecito for the soul, coffee for the soul, in which we have conversations as well as our podcast. You can follow us on Pochas So What and find us on Spotify, on Anchor, on Google and Apple podcasts. We are on Facebook on Twitter and as well, if you want to know more about all that, about ODA, you can also look for them on social media as Otros Dreams en Accion and hopefully I will be starting also my Instagram a lot more with mermaiding.

So follow Pochas So What so that then you can see where I'm at. 

**Well, thank you very much. Thank you very much, Leni for your time today.**

Thank you, Miki
